This repo includes the supporting notebooks for my series of blog posts exploring various actuarial topics through the lens of a novel insurance product, Knowledge Depreciation Guarantee (KDG), which covers sudden drops in value (measured by $\text{utility} \times \text{truthfulness}$) of knowledge assets, such as academic research papers.
